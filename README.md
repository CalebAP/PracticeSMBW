# PracticeSMBW
A speedrunning practice mod for New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Inspired by [Romain's BetterSMBW](https://github.com/R0mainSR/BetterSMBW).

## Installation
To install this mod, follow these steps:
1. Download Riivolution via one of the many online written/video tutorials
2. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/CalebAP/PracticeSMBW/releases) section of this page and download the .zip file onto your computer
3. Unzip the file directly into the root of your Wii's sd card/usb stick (you may remove the licence and readme file if you wish)
4. Put the sd card/usb stick back into the Wii, and launch Riivolution
5. Enable the category that you are practicing (only one, if multiple are chosen at the same time, it will not work)
6. Hit launch and start practicing

## Features
- [BetterIGT by TheCodingBoy](https://github.com/LetsPlentendo-CH/BetterIGT) allowing for presice in game time measurement
- All Any% levels have pipes added to reset various sections of the levels and the time limit set to 900
- 8-1 and 8-2 can optionally have the meteors removed, causing annoying RNG to no longer screw with your practice
- 8-Airship has multiple pipes in the Bowser Jr. boss fight to allow for continuous bombless practice, and can supply you with extra propellers
- Categories other than Any% currently in developement, see below for more details

### Other Categories
- All NoW5 levels will be released soon, within 2 weeks (as of Feb. 6)
- Low% levels 50% done
- Cannonless/ARE levels will be worked on after the completion of low%, and will be released at the same time due to the levels being largely the same
- No 100% levels have been edited yet, and due to the length of the category, it is not currently being worked on (sorry :\)
